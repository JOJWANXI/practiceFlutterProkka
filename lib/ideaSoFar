1. MVVM ARCHITECTURE: done
    View: Widget display present the data to the user (UI)
    ViewModel:
        from Model to ViewModel:
    Model

2. still thinking -- do later:
    a. fileViewModel class line 19 -- the type later prob custom
    FilePickerResult? result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
            type: FileType.any, );

    c. PathConfig class -- locate the full path of Prokka -- potential solutions
    I. checks the common paths when the application first runs
    or when the user navigates to the settings page.
    If none of the paths work -- indicating that the Prokka installation was not found,
    and provide an input field for the user to enter a custom path.
    II. scripts
    III. bundling/packaging
