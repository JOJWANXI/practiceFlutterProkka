1. MVVM ARCHITECTURE:
    View: Widget display present the data to the user (UI)
        -- FileView file: FilePicker, FileNameDisplay, ContentPage

    ViewModel:
        from Model to ViewModel:

    Model:
        -- FileModel: hold the state of the selected file and handles file reading


2. still thinking -- do later:
    a. main.dart class line 20 -- prob change this provider into fileView file
        return ChangeNotifierProvider(
            create: (context) => FileModel(), );

    b. fileViewModel class line 19 -- the type later prob custom
    FilePickerResult? result = await FilePicker.platform.pickFiles(
            type: FileType.any, );

    c. PathConfig class -- locate the full path of Prokka -- potential solutions
    I. checks the common paths when the application first runs
    or when the user navigates to the settings page.
    If none of the paths work -- indicating that the Prokka installation was not found,
    and provide an input field for the user to enter a custom path.
    II. scripts
    III. bundling/packaging
