# try_prokka1 (on-going)
Self-Introduction
After completing my unit in FIT2081 (Mobile Application Development) in June 2023, I discovered my passion for UI design and application development. I also found out about an exciting tool called Flutter and started exploring it in July 2023.

In the first half of 2023, I learned about Prokka, a Linux tool for genome annotation and modeling, through my studies in Advanced Bioinformatics in my free time. Inspired by this experience, I embarked on the project try_prokka1 at the end of July 2023. This project serves as a personal exploration to get familiar with Flutter, learn architectural patterns like MVVM, and the bioinformatics knowledge.

The goal of this project is to make Linux command-line tools, particularly Prokka, more accessible and user-friendly by building a GUI. This interface aims to bridge the gap between Linux's capabilities and modern GUI's ease of use, allowing complex tasks without typing out full syntax.

Current Features (Subject to Future Improvements)
File Selection: Enable easy file selection and upload.
Command Visualization: Intuitively present available Linux commands.
Prokka Integration: Integration with Prokka for bacteria analysis.
Annotation Mode Selection: Selection of various annotation modes.
Responsive Design: Adapts to various screen sizes for optimal user experience.
