# try_prokka1 (on-going | self-studies)
**Self-Introduction**
After completing my unit in FIT2081 (Mobile Application Development) in June 2023, I discovered my passion for UI design and application development. I also found out about an exciting tool called Flutter and started exploring it in July 2023.

In the first half of 2023, I learned about Prokka, a Linux tool for genome annotation and modeling, through my studies in Advanced Bioinformatics in my free time. Inspired by this experience, I embarked on the project try_prokka1 at the end of July 2023. This project serves as a personal exploration to get familiar with Flutter, learn architectural patterns like MVVM, and the bioinformatics knowledge.(All are new knowledge and fields I learn in 2023)

The goal of this project is to make Linux command-line tools, particularly Prokka, more accessible and user-friendly by building a GUI. This interface aims to bridge the gap between Linux's capabilities and modern GUI's ease of use, allowing complex tasks without typing out full syntax.

**Current Features (Subject to Future Improvements)**
 
    File Management: Facilitates user interaction with genome annotation files(try to understand MVVM).
    Prokka Integration: Offers functionalities such as checking Prokka's version and executing genome annotation tasks.
    Responsive UI: Adapts layout according to screen size for a seamless user experience.
    Custom Theme and Error Handling: Enhances UI appeal and stability.

**Getting Started**
